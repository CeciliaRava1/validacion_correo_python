# Email Address Validation in Python

This project demonstrates how to validate email addresses using Python. The validation is done by checking the structure of the email address, ensuring that it meets common criteria for valid email addresses.

## Features

- Validates the username part of the email address.
- Validates the domain part of the email address.
- Validates the domain extension part of the email address.
- Ensures the overall length and format of the email address are correct.
